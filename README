# stard README

Thank you for trying stard. This collection of scripts is designed to provide a general manager for the starmade deamon. 


####### Before you install ######
Check to ensure you have the following dependancies installed:
- perl >= 5
- perl File::Basename module
- perl File::Path module
- perl Text::ParseWords module
- perl Config::IniFiles module
- perl Proc::Daemon module
- bash
- python
- java (You need this to run starmade)
- StarMade-Starter.jar (Get it at http://www.starmade.org/download)

###### Installation Instructions ######
#install with the following commands:


tar -xzvf stard.tar.gz
cd stard-0.0.1
./configure
make

# root is required to install as it will be 
# creating a starmade user to run everything 
# under as well as putting the init script 
# in place which must be done as root!

sudo make install

# put the StarMade-Starter.jar file you downloaded in /var/starmade/tools/
# (get it at http://www.starmade.org/download)
sudo cp StarMade-Starter.jar /var/starmade/tools/
sudo chmod 644 /var/starmade/tools/StarMade-Starter.jar

# This may take a long time to start, as it will use the StarMade-Starter to download starmade.
# you can watch the install by looking at the /var/starmade/stard/log/launcher.log
sudo service stard start

# check to make sure everything looks ok:
sudo service stard status

# wait about a minute, it can take a minute before starmade to collect itself.
sudo /var/starmade/stard/bin/stard_test

# if both of those come back ok, you should be set :)
# if not, it is now safe to begin crying :'(
